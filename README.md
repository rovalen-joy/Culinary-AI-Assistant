## Project Title: Chefmate: Crafted for Your Cravings

## Project Overview
<div align="justify">
Chefmate is a generative AI application developed for the final project of the CCS 229 Intelligent Systems course. This intelligent system interacts with users through multi-level prompting and leverages OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate customized food recommendations. Users can input their craving type, calorie preferences, ingredient preferences, allergies, nutritional goals, and cooking skill level to receive personalized recipes.

## Features
- **Multi-level Prompting**: Chefmate uses a series of sequential prompts to gather detailed user input. Initially, users specify their cravings (e.g., "something sweet"), followed by selecting a cuisine type (e.g., "Italian", "Mexican"). Further refinement includes setting a preferred calorie range through a slider, specifying preferred ingredients, listing any allergies, stating nutritional goals (e.g., "low-carb"), and indicating their cooking skill level (e.g., "Beginner"). This step-by-step approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of user preferences.
- **GPT-3 Integration**: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate creative and personalized text formats based on user inputs.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Developed using Streamlit, the interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, providing a seamless user experience.
